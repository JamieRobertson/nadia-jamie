            <h4>Instructions</h4>

            <p>As a backup these are instructions on how to get there.</p>

            <ul>
                <li class="mb-5">From the city centre, follow the signs for <b>Perth A85</b></li>

                <li class="mb-5">On the A85 after approx. 4.5 ml (7 km) you arrive at a roundabout. Head for <b>Perth A90</b>.</li>

                <li class="mb-5">After approx. 4.5 ml (7 km) on the A90 (ignoring an earlier brown sign for Inchture) exit at a green sign reading: <br>
                    <b>Inchture</b> <br>
                    <b>Abernyte</b> <br>
                    <b>Kinnaird</b> <br>
                    <b>B953</b>
                </li>

                <li class="mb-5">Turn right at the next roundabout following the sign reading: <br>
                    <b>Abernyte</b> <br>
                    <b>Kinnaird</b> <br>
                    <b>B953</b>
                </li>

                <li class="mb-5">You cross back over the A90 then turn right at the next roundabout, following <b>Kinnaird</b>.</li>

                <li class="mb-5">Shortly after this turn left at the next junction, again following <b>Kinnaird</b>.</li>

                <li class="mb-5">Stay on this road and eventually you’ll drive through a small place named Ballindean. Keep going.</li>

                <li class="mb-5">After another 1 mile (1.6 km) approx. you come to a crossroads. Turn right here.</li>

                <li class="mb-5">Drive up the hill until a junction. Ignore the Kinnaird Village sign. Take the sharp bend to the right, following the <b>Abernyte</b> sign.</li>

                <li class="mb-5">Continue on the road for approx. 0.5 ml (0.85 km) and you come to a sharp left-hand bend. Immediately after the bend the entrance to Guardswell is on the left.</li>

                <li class="mb-5">Continue up the main driveway and you’ll find ample parking behind the main buildings.</li>
